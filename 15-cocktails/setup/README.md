## Cocktails

Built with React with use of `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, `react-rouder-dom` components such as `Router`, `Switch`, `Route`, and `Link`.

Used `useContext` to store states and functions globally, and creating a custom hook that returns the `useContext` function to reduce imports in other components.
